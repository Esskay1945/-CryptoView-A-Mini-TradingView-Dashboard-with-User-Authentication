# -CryptoView-A-Mini-TradingView-Dashboard-with-User-Authentication
Track multiple cryptocurrencies in real-time with a clean UI and secure user login system. Built using Streamlit, SQLite, Plotly, and CoinGecko API.

CryptoView is a streamlined, real-time cryptocurrency dashboard that allows users to track the latest price movements of multiple digital currencies in an interactive and user-friendly interface. Built with Python and Streamlit, the app integrates user authentication using SQLite, enabling secure login and registration via email. Once authenticated, users are presented with a dynamic dashboard that fetches live data from the CoinGecko API, displaying charts and statistics for a wide range of popular cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and many others. The UI is clean and responsive, with features like dropdown selection, real-time price metrics (current price, 24h high/low), and interactive Plotly charts for visual insights. CryptoView is designed to resemble the core experience of platforms like TradingView but at a smaller scale, making it an excellent learning project or a lightweight analytics tool for crypto enthusiasts and developers alike.
